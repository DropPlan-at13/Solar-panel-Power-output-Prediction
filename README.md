# ☀️ Solar Panel Power Output Prediction

This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict the **power output of solar panels** based on **weather conditions** such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight intensity.  

The goal is to provide an efficient way to estimate the energy production of installed solar panels, which can help in **energy planning, optimization, and sustainability efforts**.

This version is:
- **Professional** (good structure, headings, sections)  
- **Flexible** (has placeholders for images, results, and metrics)  
- **Impressive** (includes future improvements + technologies used)  

Would you like me to also **add a workflow diagram (ASCII or image placeholder)** showing the pipeline → data → model → prediction → results? That would make it look even more industry-grade.
